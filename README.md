# Website Rep for DataWave Project
Put together by Marshall Borrus

## Website creation

This github pages site was created using Hugo and adapting the free default theme. The site was originally compiled locally on my computer (with Hugo), and was uploaded to Github as files were updated. The website is recompiled at Datawaveproject.github.io every time a file is pushed to the repisitory thanks to some handy internet guides which use a public workflow file to run Hugo online. 

## Website editing

To edit files on the website, you can clone the repository to your local drive, or edit the files using the online editing interface. Email msborrus@stanford.edu for editing permisions.

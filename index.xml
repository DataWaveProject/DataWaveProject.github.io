      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;advisor-françois-lott-in-collaboration-with-r-plougonven-h-hertzog-and-a-podglagen-from-lmd&#34;&gt;Advisor: François Lott in collaboration with R. Plougonven, H. Hertzog and A. Podglagen from LMD.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2-year post doctoral position is opening at the “Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique” to work on the parameterization of atmospheric gravity waves in the IPSL Climate model. The candidate will develop off-line versions of the operational subgrid scale parameterizations of gravity waves that are related to mountains (Lott and Miller 1997), convection (Lott and Guez 2013) and fronts (de la Camara and Lott 2016) and guide them with analysis field from  ECMWF.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Seasonal and Latitudinal Variability of the Gravity Wave Spectrum in the Lower Stratosphere</title>

      <description>Superpressure balloon data of unprecedented coverage from Loon LLC is used to investigate the seasonal and latitudinal variability of lower stratospheric gravity waves over the entire intrinsic frequency spectrum. We show that seasonal variability in both gravity wave amplitudes and spectral slopes exist for a wide range of intrinsic frequencies and provide estimates of spectral slopes in five latitudinal regions for all four seasons, in five different frequency windows.</description>

      <description>Three hundred and forty-eight years, six months, and nineteen days ago to-day, the Parisians awoke to the sound of all the bells in the triple circuit of the city, the university, and the town ringing a full peal.
The sixth of January, 1482, is not, however, a day of which history has preserved the memory. There was nothing notable in the event which thus set the bells and the bourgeois of Paris in a ferment from early morning.</description>

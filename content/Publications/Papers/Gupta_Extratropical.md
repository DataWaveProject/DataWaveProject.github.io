## Abstract:
The study presents (a) a 44-year wintertime climatology of resolved gravity wave (GW) fluxes and forcing in the extratropical stratosphere using ERA5, and (b) their composite evolution around gradual (final warming) and abrupt (sudden warming) transitions in the wintertime circulation, focusing on lateral fluxes. The transformed Eulerian mean equations are leveraged to provide a glimpse of the importance of GW lateral propagation (i.e., horizontal propagation) toward driving the wintertime stratospheric circulation by analyzing the relative contribution of the vertical versus meridional flux dissipation.

The relative contribution from lateral propagation is found to be notable, especially in the Austral winter stratosphere where lateral (vertical) momentum flux convergence provides a peak climatological forcing of up to −0.5 (−3.5) m/s/day around 60°S at 40–45 km altitude. Prominent lateral propagation in the wintertime midlatitudes also contributes to the formation of belts of GW activity in both hemispheres.

## Plain Language Summary:
Atmospheric Gravity Waves (GWs) are atmospheric disturbances created by processes like convection, thunderstorms, flow over topography, etc. These waves can have wavelengths as small as 1 km to as large as 1,000–2,000 km. Most atmospheric GWs are not resolved in coarse-resolution climate models. As a result, they are represented in climate models using parameterizations, which are approximate models that can be subject to various idealizations. One such idealization is the assumption of pure vertical propagation of GWs. In this study, we use multidecadal records from ERA5 reanalysis—which combines a high-resolution model with assimilated observations to produce a close-to-observed state of the atmosphere and resolves some of these GWs—to quantify the impact of this assumption on the mean state of the extratropical stratosphere. This is done by extracting GWs from ERA5 data, computing horizontal momentum fluxes carried by these waves, and comparing the net acceleration/deceleration provided by these fluxes on the peak winter stratospheric circulation and key episodes of abrupt changes in the circulation. Analysis using ERA5 reveals that horizontal propagation of GWs can be notable in the midlatitude stratosphere, highlighting the need to develop GW parameterizations that represent this essential property of atmospheric GWs.

## Key Points:
1. Climatology of lateral fluxes from ERA5 shows substantial lateral propagation of gravity waves in both hemispheres
2. Contribution of both lateral and vertical GW fluxes toward zonal wind forcing is the same order of magnitude
3. Abrupt changes in GW forcing in the upper stratosphere around sudden stratospheric warmings persist even 20 days following the event

Aditi Sheshadri, based at Stanford University, is DataWave’s lead PI. Prior to DataWave, Sheshadri studied atmospheric dynamics involving the jetstream and the polar vortex. Using this background, Sheshadri took on the role of Coordinating PI and Head of Task 1: Loon Observations and Gravity Wave Momentum Flux Estimates. She works with her group to analyze previously untouched high resolution Loon balloon data with the goal of integrating the data into climate model’s parameterizations of gravity waves.

  Sheshadri's leading motivation for this project was the desire to develop more accurate climate models for predicting climate change. In fact, her excitement for this project stems from the Loon data observations, as they are a source of unprecedented high resolution (not to mention free) data for her group to use. With gravity wave research being an “underserved area in which climate model accuracy could be drastically improved”, Sheshadri worked to build a team with expertise in regional and global simulations of high resolution models of gravity waves, balloon observations, and those from large climate modeling centers. She hopes that by involving highly qualified international researchers, the project can benefit from diverse input into gravity wave parameterization and climate model enhancement. 
   
  Within Sheshadri’s group (including Brian Green, Laura Mansfield, Marshall Borrus, and Catherine Wilka), tasks have been strategically divided to analyze the Loon data observations. Green is using wavelet methods to identify momentum fluxes associated with the gravity waves, while others are focusing on upper atmospheric mixing and machine learning. Through these tasks, the ultimate goal for Sheshadri’s group is to generate gravity wave parameterizations that are accurate, computationally cheap, and constrained by the observation data and high resolution output. 
	
  As a result of DataWave, Sheshadri believes that within atmospheric dynamics gravity waves will be defined with a greater importance for the scientific community. This is especially significant when addressing the momentum budget of the jetstream, the variability of gravity waves, the importance of gravity wave generation and propagation on setting the large scale structure of the atmosphere, and the importance of gravity wave estimates on the change in climate. Currently, Sheshadri is teaching a class, Climate Models and Data, in which students come from all different disciplines and backgrounds who are interested in climate models, as understanding climate change is crucial in decision making for other fields of work. For this reason Sheshadri believes that any work that moves towards increasing accuracy of climate model projections and estimating uncertainties of projections has wide ranging impacts on the scientific and non-scientific community alike. 
	
  In the last six months, challenges in projecting horizontal propagation of gravity waves have arisen in Sheshadri’s group because most climate models only permit waves to propagate in the vertical dimension. In response, the group seeks to use high resolution model output and balloon observations to constrain, inform, and improve the lower resolution climate models that currently exist. They are also working with machine learning to integrate the horizontal propagation of these gravity waves into these models. 
	
  Sheshadri hopes this project “will lead to implementable changes into state of the art climate models”, as well as the generation of  “observationally constrained estimates” of gravity waves. However, the ultimate goal of the project is to generate a paradigm shift in the way global climate model centers represent gravity waves.

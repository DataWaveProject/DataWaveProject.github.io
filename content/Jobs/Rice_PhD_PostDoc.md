  <p> The <a href="http://pedram.rice.edu/">Rice University Environmental Fluid Dynamics Group</a> has multiple postdoc and PhD positions in the following two topics (and at their intersection):<br>  
    1) Applications of machine learning (ML) to improve the modeling and prediction of turbulent flows, atmospheric processes, climate change, and weather extremes.<br>  
    2) Understanding the dynamics and future changes of the extratropical, large-scale atmospheric circulation variability, with a particular focus on blocking events and annular modes. <!--This project is part of two multi-disciplinary collaborative initiatives involving several US and international teams: <a href="https://datawaveproject.github.io/">DataWave</a> and <a href="https://cssi-gws.github.io/">CSSI-GW</a>.--> </p>

Regarding (1), one topic of particular interest is developing rigorous frameworks for interpreting/explaining deep neural networks and analyzing their stability, out-of-distribution generalization, and error bounds for applications involving multi-scale dynamical systems such as turbulent flows and the climate system. One objective of this project is to support two multi- disciplinary collaborative initiatives involving several US and international teams focused on developing subgrid-scale parameterizations for atmospheric gravity waves by leveraging high- resolution simulations, observational data, and novel ML techniques.

Regarding (2), the main interest is in using hierarchical modeling and novel approaches to analyzing eddy-mean flow interactions and deriving scaling laws to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamical mechanisms of blocking events and annular modes, and their future changes under global warming.

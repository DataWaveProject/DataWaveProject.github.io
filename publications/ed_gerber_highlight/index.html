<p>Datawave co-PI Ed Gerber focuses on atmospheric dynamics and idealized modeling, and is deeply interested in global circulation and how weather systems respond to warming. Gerber is co-head of Datawave Task 5: Gravity Wave Impacts in climate projections, and outside the project he considers the effect of heat waves and precipitation changes on wind structures in the stratosphere. Within Datawave, they specifically address atmospheric gravity waves through data-driven parameterizations, which involves implementation of machine learning applied to parameterizations of various scales, &ldquo;from city-sized grid blocks to larger regions represented by multiple grid blocks&rdquo;. He’s interested in coupling these parameterizations with climate modeling to develop more reliable climate predictions.</p>
<p>Gerber’s involvement with Datawave stems from his interest in using Loon balloon data as a new tool to simplify physical restrictions of models through incorporating this new dataset. This innovative climate modeling method encourages him to focus on reproducing existing parameterizations to test whether they will function appropriately in the future when developed into climate models. These new approaches will also rely significantly on machine learning, which represents an exciting opportunity for improving climate models, along with the challenge of understanding the processes by which these results are derived.</p>
<p>As research and climate modeling goes, Gerber has encountered both challenges and encouraging successes as a member of Datawave. Challenges include developing models that more completely represent gravity waves, their complexity, and their diversity of sources. However, they have been heartened by developments such as with experiments expanding the <a href="http://mjucker.github.io/MiMA/">MiMA</a> climate model and with implementing neural networks and a more data-driven approach to capture the physical properties of gravity waves in parametrizations. Gerber also cites virtual journal meetings with project leads and collaborating through students and postdocs as key to accessing new perspectives and driving the project forwards.</p>
<p>From DataWave’s project goals, Gerber believes that the scientific community will be equipped with the modeling results to make more accurate climate predictions, such as by better representing jet streams in the tropics. He also highlights possible benefits in representing stratospheric variability by more reliably accounting for temperature shifts due to wind circulation and coupling that occurs between the stratosphere and the troposphere. As for the non-scientific community, Gerber believes that these improved climate models will provide more confidence in future climate predictions, and that Datawave will provide fundamental science for further climate model improvements, which will be especially important in predicting and responding to future extreme weather events. Additionally, he views Datawave’s collaboration with labs worldwide as important for encouraging collaboration among the climate modeling community.</p>
<p>Gerber also highlights the importance of these improved climate models for future studies as they intend to revolutionize the process of climate modeling, as new methods may uncover new questions in how to represent climate more accurately. Additionally, Gerber believes these models will be crucial in prompting stronger communication and collaboration between scientists and policymakers while addressing climate-related issues.</p>
